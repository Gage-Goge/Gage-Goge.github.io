<p>Now this looks like it's Black Ops 3.</p>
<p>Fuck Roger Taylor! He's such a badass bitch. I don't know what the fuck to write here.</p>
<p>So, in that case.</p>
<h2>I AM SORRY ROGER TAYLOR!</h2>
<p>I truly did not mean any of the things I said here.</p>
<h3>I, being the mythic drummer of queen, ROGER TAYLOR!</h3>
<p>Yes,</p>
<p>you read that correctly.</p>
<p>It is I,</p>
<p>Roger Taylor.</p>
<p>Welcome to my blog.</p>
<p>Best hope it ain't written by a dog.</p>
<p>Because it rhymes with doorhinge</p>
<p>and Donny Trump is orange</p>
<p>When I pass, they shout "Whore! Cringe!"</p>
<p>And now I'm downing his porridge.</p>
<p>Because whatever they really tell you it is,</p>
<p>It is not.</p>
